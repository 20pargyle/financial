features:
    Transactions, each with
        transaction amount, income/expense, name (company or person), timestamp (include time or not?), categories (v2), misc notes

    Expense graphs
        monthly, yearly, or all time

    interesting stats
        with notifications
            eg Apple screen time: your expenses were down 20% this month... awesome job!

    I'd like to track how often I need certain things on average OR how long they last
        ie. how often I need shower gel... or smoothie materials!
        With a robust system, I can then more easily estimate future expenses
            How do we know how often things are purchased? receipt scanning?
